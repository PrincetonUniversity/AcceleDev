      <h2>Project &amp; Chemistry Expertise Summary</h2>

      <p>
Our primary expertise is the research and development of challenging chemistry processes which are 1-20 reaction steps in length. Rather than promote expertise in a specific technology or reaction, our core strength is instead in our ability to skillfully manage each &amp; every piece of the sophisticated chemistry and wide range of conditions required in these types of lengthy routes and new development programs. Our chemists can design the entire route themselves, or simply optimize a literature or customer provided route. Customers often like to start work with us in the very early stages where quantities are small and chemistry undeveloped. Our low production cost base and commercial production capabilities, also make us a supplier of choice for working on a wide range of pilot and commercial production projects as well. In those cases, our clients utilize our ability to design and develop greener, lower-cost processes for their anticipated regular commercial production. This work is performed at both our USA and China sites, and proposals quoted in price per gram kilo, or on FTE basis

        <h2>Process Design &amp; Custom Synthesis</h2>

        <p>
        AcceleDev has over 100 experienced R&amp;D personnel with 
        expertise in custom chemical synthesis. We have years of 
        experience designing creative, multi-step routes to 
        produce high yields of complicated and challenging
        molecules in a wide range of volumes from milligrams to
        metric tons. Flexibility in any situation is one of our 
        most well-known assets, and we can comfortably develop 
        chemistry that can meet an urgent requirement, or change 
        focus and investigate hundreds of reaction parameters to 
        fine-tune process efficiency for the future. We are also 
        experienced in the art of impurity profiling, and all 
        the analytical method development and process design 
        required to meet any challenging impurity specification. 
        Our partners gain exceptional value by combining 
        our top-of-the-line process design expertise with our
        unparalleled pilot- and large-scale production capabilities.

      <h2>Pilot and Commercial Production</h2>

      <p>
      With multiple specialized facilities and over 700 personnel 
      with expertise in production, site management, environmental 
      health and safety, and quality assurance, AcceleDev is an 
      able partner at any step of the production process. We have the 
      equipment and expertise to work at the gram scale for 
      optimization, the kilogram scale for pilot production, 
      and the metric ton scale for full commercial production. 
      Our core network of sites gives us the luxury of having 
      a wide range of specialized production equipment, which 
      allows us to successfully handle a wider range of 
      chemistry processing conditions, and ultimately improves 
      the project cost and lead time for our clients. Our 
      experienced scientists fluently implement both
      chemical processes we design or optimize ourselves, and 
      pathways that we recieve directly from the customer.

        <h2>Sourcing &amp; Supply Chain Management Advantage</h2>

        <p>
We have been sourcing raw materials in China and qualifying both suppliers and products for more than 20 years. Our raw material sourcing database now holds records on more than 25,000 different molecules and 9,000 different Chinese suppliers. As part of our daily sourcing activities, our China team is required to "qualify suppliers", and place all related information into our company database for future reference. All materials are tested, vendor performance monitored, and results assessed and strictly placed into the database. The result of all these efforts gives us an ability to find local raw materials very quickly, while preventing wasted time in working with unreliable high risk suppliers. This has proven to greatly reduce our internal R&amp;D and production lead times, while giving our teams a greater range of materials and suppliers to choose from. On special request from our close customer-partners, we also perform a customized sourcing and supplier selection service to fit their individual needs for purchasing Chinese materials. This includes material lot-to-lot analysis work, packaging service, factory visits and pre-audits, and full export management including customs clearance and door-to-door delivery.

        <h2>Technology &amp; Product Experience</h2>

        <p>
Over the course of the 1,000’s of projects performed over the years, we have built-up an extensive amount of knowledge and experience designing, optimizing, and producing chemical processes. Much of our work is under confidentiality protection. However, we do advertise some of the molecules that we have developed, produced, supplied over the years. Though we do also re-supply these, we mostly pride ourselves on primarily being a custom synthesis innovator, focusing on new research &amp; development. As part of our core company philosophy, we hold the highest regard for confidentiality, detailed and regular communication, quality and environmental health and safety.
