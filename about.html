      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
      AcceleDev Chemical, LLC was founded in 2003 by Charlie Lewis, a former
      research and development scientist at Sigma Aldrich. For the next several
      years, the company distinguished inself in chemical supply chain
      management, forging key partnerships with customers and high-quality
      chemical suppliers in China. AcceleDev was among the first American
      chemical companies to establish partnerships with Chinese chemistry
      professionals to offer on-site analytical testing, a necessary feature
      still rare in the industry. The business soon established its own
      research and development capabilities, and Lewis founded AcceleDev
      R&amp;D Co. Ltd. in 2006. In 2009, AcceleDev added a new facility in
      Haimen, China to complement its developmet expertise with the capacity
      for full-scale commercial production. Now, AcceleDev continues to grow,
      hiring western-trained chemists in both the U.S. and China and
      developing innovative processes from pilot- to large-scale chemical
      production.

      <h2>Why we're unique</h2>

      <h3>Native in the US. Native in China.</h3>

      <p>
      In addition to our expertise in chemistry R&amp;D and production
      generally, we have particular experience working with the American
      and European pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Our
      scientists in the United States and China have over a decade of
      experience working together to complete these projects to
      specification and on time, so that no time is lost translating our
      clients' specialized needs from our Western lab to our production
      facilities in China. We were also among the first American
      companies to have its own analytical facilities in China, and no
      one has a more accurate and reliable supply chain for high-purity
      raw materials.
      </p>

      <h3>Every Step.</h3>

      <p>
      AcceleDev's scientists and facilities support the full chemical 
      production pipeline, from process design and development to
      pilot and full-scale commercial production. We can help clients
      at any step, to devise or refine a synthesis, to scale up an
      existing process, and to manufacture and ship a commercial chemical
      product. With AcceleDev, you don't need any other supplier.
      </p>

      <h3>R&amp;D Expertise.</h3>

      <p>
      Many of our scientists come from major pharmaceutical companies,
      and are well-aware of the needs and standards required to work with
      clients in that industry. Our R&amp;D experience even shows in
      our manufacturing capabilities, because we monitor our processes
      to ensure that they scale properly.
      </p>

      <h3>Rapid, Constant Communication.</h3>

      <p>
      AcceleDev prides itself on transparency and responsiveness from
      the moment we hear from a potential client. All requests for a quote
      are given serious consideration and answered in a timely fashion.
      Once we begin working together, AcceleDev sends weekly updates
      on project status, and we are always available to discuss and
      refine an active project.
