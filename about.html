    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
    AcceleDev Chemical, LLC was founded in 2003 by Charlie Lewis, a former
    research and development scientist at Sigma Aldrich. For the next several
    years, the company distinguished inself in chemical supply chain
    management, forging key partnerships with customers and high-quality
    chemical suppliers in China. AcceleDev was among the first American
    chemical companies to establish partnerships with Chinese chemistry
    professionals to offer on-site analytical testing, a necessary feature
    still rare in the industry. The business soon established its own
    research and development capabilities, and Lewis founded AcceleDev
    R&amp;D Co. Ltd. in 2006. In 2009, AcceleDev added a new facility in
    Haimen, China to complement its developmet expertise with the capacity
    for full-scale commercial production. Now, AcceleDev continues to grow,
    hiring western-trained chemists in both the U.S. and China and
    developing innovative processes from pilot- to large-scale chemical
    production.
