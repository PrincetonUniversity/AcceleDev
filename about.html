      <h2>History</h2>


      <p>
AcceleDev was founded in April 2003 by Charlie Lewis, a former process research and development chemist at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Since that time, Acceledev has built-up and further strengthened its comprehensive set of R&D, production and supply chain assets, located in both China and USA. This build-up includes both significant investment and key partnerships, which greatly strengthened the overall operations and broadened our capabilities. Some of these include AcceleDev R&D Co. Ltd in 2007, cGMP regulatory starting material production site Seagate-AcceleDev in 2010, and most recently our new USA research facility in 2012. In addition to these, we also continue to maintain our long term strategic integrated partnerships which give our customers an even wider range of supply flexibility. Each of our sites has a unique set of chemistry, analytical, and operations capabilities. Our customers deeply appreciate the range of options given to them. AcceleDev core expertise is in the design, development and production of multistep synthetic pathways to unique and diverse wide range of chemical molecules. Our multinational US and China teams allow us to maximize all the advantages which can be gained from both regions. Our mission is simple: Provide high quality product on time, & cost-effectively, while also holding in highest regard our customer's need for responsive and regular communication.

      <h2>Why We're Unique</h2>
      <h3>Every Step.</h3>

      <p>
      AcceleDev's scientists and facilities support the full chemical 
      production pipeline, from process design and development to
      pilot and full-scale commercial production. We can help clients
      at any step, to devise or refine a synthesis, to scale up an
      existing process, and to manufacture and ship a commercial chemical
      product, helping you avoid the extra risk and time loss 
      that come from multiple project transfers. With AcceleDev, 
      you don't need any other supplier.
      </p>

      <h3>Rapid, Constant Communication.</h3>

      <p>
      AcceleDev prides itself on transparency and responsiveness from
      the moment we recieve a request until the project is sucessfully
      finished. All requests for a quote are given serious 
      consideration and answered quickly, typically within 1-3 days' 
      time. Once we begin working together, we are always available 
      to discuss refinement of an active project to meet 
      new targets. We work openly and are highly committed to regular 
      and professional communication.
