        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
        AcceleDev was founded in April 2003 by Charlie Lewis, a 
        former research and development chemist at Bristol-Myers 
        Squibb, and the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Since that time,
        Acceledev has built-up and further strengthened its 
        comprehensive set of R&D, production and supply chain 
        assets, located in both China and USA. This build-up 
        includes both significant investment and key 
        partnerships, which greatly strengthened the overall 
        operations and broadened our capabilities. Some of these 
        include AcceleDev R&D Co. Ltd in 2007, Seagate-AcceleDev 
        production in 2010, and most recently our new USA 
        research facility in 2011. In addition to these, we also 
        continue to maintain our long term strategic integrated 
        partnerships which give our customers an even greater 
        degree of supply flexibility. Each of our sites has a unique 
        set of chemistry and operations capabilities. These combine 
        to give a comprehensive range of choices for our customers.  
        Our expertise has continued to specialize in the design, 
        development and production of multistep synthetic pathways 
        to unique and diverse wide range of chemical molecules. 
        Our multinational local US and China teams allow us to 
        maximize all the advantages which can be gained from both 
        regions. Our mission is simple: Wok cost efficiently, 
        and provide high quality product on time, while also 
        holding in highest regard our customer's need for 
        responsive and regular communication.

        companies, small biotechnology start-ups, and everyone in 
        between. In keeping with our stellar record of service, 
        our scientists can create or optimize reaction pathways to 
        complicated molecules, and then produce them on any scale. 
        We have an extensive and wide range of in-house chemistry 
        technology, and the support of a strong, strategic raw 
        material sourcing engine. These capabilities allow our 
        customers' important programs to run more quickly and under 
        far reduced risk. To learn more about our unique combination

        <h2>Why we're unique</h2>

        <h3>Native in the US. Native in China.</h3>

        <p>
        In addition to our expertise in chemistry R&amp;D and production
        generally, we also have significant experience working closely
        with many different clients from the American
        and European pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Our
        scientists in the United States and China have over a decade of
        experience working together to complete these projects to
        specification and on time, so that no time is lost translating our
        clients' specialized needs from our Western lab to our production
        facilities in China. We were also among the first American
        companies to have its own analytical facilities in China, and no
        one has a more accurate and reliable supply chain for high-purity
        raw materials.
        </p>

        <h3>Every Step.</h3>

        <p>
        AcceleDev's scientists and facilities support the full chemical 
        production pipeline, from process design and development to
        pilot and full-scale commercial production. We can help clients
        at any step, to devise or refine a synthesis, to scale up an
        existing process, and to manufacture and ship a commercial chemical
        product, helping you avoid the extra risk and time loss 
        that come from multiple project transfers. With AcceleDev, 
        you don't need any other supplier.
        </p>

        <h3>R&amp;D Expertise.</h3>

        <p>
        Many of our scientists come from major pharmaceutical companies,
        and are well-aware of the needs and standards required to work 
        with clients in that industry. Our team holds a broad range of 
        chemistry training and experience from our roots in western 
        pharmaceutical R&amp;D, industrial pilot and commercial 
        production, and academia. This broad range of knowledge gives 
        us the skill and supported confidence to develop and scale 
        any challenging multistep chemistry process. Our R&amp;D 
        experience even shows in our manufacturing capabilities, 
        because we monitor all our processes
        to ensure that they always scale properly.
        </p>

        <h3>Rapid, Constant Communication.</h3>

        <p>
        AcceleDev prides itself on transparency and responsiveness from
        the moment we recieve a request until the project is sucessfully
        finished. All requests for a quote are given serious 
        consideration and answered quickly, typically within 1-3 days' 
        time. Once we begin working together, we are always available 
        to discuss refinement of an active project to meet 
        new targets. We work openly and are highly committed to regular 
        and professional communication.
