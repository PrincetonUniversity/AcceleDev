Things to ask Charlie about from keynotes doc:
- Should news page be ascending or descending?

Home:
- I don't think "chemistry company" sounds professional, or even grammatical
- The little blurbs at the bottom shouldn't be that long. The whole point
  of them is to be concise...
- "team chemistry knowledge" is ungrammatical and dumb
- "Western pharmaceutical R&D" might not be good either since it's in a 
  paragraph about cross-cultural collaboration
    - further note: this phrase is used WAY too often in the new content

About:
- History paragraph full of grammar mistakes
- should not write "Bristol-Meyer-Squibb Company", just Bristol-Meyer-Squibb.
  Also its Sigma Aldrich Co. Inc. =  Company Incorporated, not Corporation...
- in What we Do paragraph, "extensive and wide range" is redundant.
- What we Stand For section: "standards in which we work" is wrong
  Also "customer's" shouldn't have an apostrophe
- Native paragraph: "in-tern" is SO wrong.
- Rapid Comm. paragraph: "from the moment..., and up until" Also other typos.
  Seriously do you even ENGLISH??? Also no exclamation mark.... C'mon Charlie.

Contact:
- I just rewrote the sentence. It sounded silly.

Overarching problems:
- Ampersands look stupid, especially if you use them in every sentence
- You use too many goddamn adjectives. Don't add more adjectives on a list. 
  Find an educated word that means what they both mean so you don't sound
  like a highschooler trying to meet the word requirement on a paper.
- the one thing worse than adding a list of adjectives is using a
  slash to add another adjective into an already too damn long list
- Also milligrams is mg, not Mg. Mg is Mega grams = grams * 10^6. You
  own a chemical company. How do you not know basic SI prefixes???
- It is not a "chemistry company", and it is certainly not a
  "chemistry process". The adjective is chemical. Learn it bitch.
