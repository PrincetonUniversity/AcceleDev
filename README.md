# AcceleDev - README.md #

Things to tell Charlie about:
- the red links are FINE. people who use the internet see different coloered
  links on a lot of websites, and blue completely clashes with the site's
  aesthetic
- tell him that the 'text changes to the News page' have all been 
  made and i have no idea what he wants
- there is no DSC_0052 in the US Facilities folder, so I left the
  current HPLC photo

        J&J’s/ Janssen Pharmaceutical’s 2014 Outstanding R&D achievement

# Facilities Pages
##  USA R&D Facility Page
- X TODO: The text(Staffed by...): Should instead say: “Staffed by 
        industry experts and located in proximity to numerous 
        pharmaceutical companies and Princeton University, 
        our New Jersey site has the full range of complimentary 
        capabilities to complete any challenging chemistry project 
        quickly & successfully”. Instead make this text smaller 
        by shrinking the font, & make it italics. Then also make 
        this grey section accordingly much smaller.
- X TODO: add maroon border to bottom of banner photo
- X TODO: I suggest to find pic “Picture 033” in the banner folder pics section & use it to instead replace the current pic in the text (stef included), next to the New Jersey Facility, United States section. Place this “Stef pic” instead next to the HPLC text section of the “Analytical Capabilities (both on-site and contracted)”. Also place this “Picture 033” in the “contacts page” as a small pic there in the text.
- X TODO: Find pic “DSC_0025” in the US facilities banner pics folder, & place next to the NMR txt section of the “Analytical Capabilities (both on-site and contracted)”

##  Nanjing R&D Facility Page
- X TODO: The text(We operate & partner….…….): Should instead say: “Staffed by industry experts and located in proximity to numerous pharmaceutical companies and Nanjing University, our Nanjing China site has the full range of complimentary capabilities to complete any challenging chemistry project quickly & successfully”. Also make this text smaller by shrinking the font, & make it italics. Then also make this grey section accordingly much smaller.

- X TODO: The text(We operate & partner….…….): Should instead say: “With multiple pilot and full commercial scale production facilities in china, we offer a wide range of reactor vessels & a team of experts that can quickly scale-up & safely commercially produce any challenging or hazardous chemistry, at low cost.” Also make this text smaller by shrinking the font, & make it italics. Then also make this grey section accordingly much smaller.
